Welcome developer. This is the second tutorial in developing your React and Spring Boot Web Application.
We will continue the apllications based on the foundation (link)
Moving forward, we will use this repository as starting point for further repositories which include JPA PostgresQL connectivity and RESTful API services.

In this tutorial we will connect the database, for which we will use a SQL database called PostgresQL. The connectivity is done via Spring Boot JPA.
HTTP requests will be handled via the RESTful API service.

### What is JPA?\*\*

**JPA**
The Java Persistence API (JPA) is a Java specification for accessing, persisting, and managing data between Java objects / classes and a relational database. JPA was defined as part of the EJB 3.0 specification as a replacement for the EJB 2 CMP Entity Beans specification.

### What is PostgreSQL

**PostgreSQL**

(pronounced "post-gress-Q-L") is an open source relational database management system ( DBMS ) developed by a worldwide team of volunteers. PostgreSQL is not controlled by any corporation or other private entity and the source code is available free of charge.

### What is Lombok?

**Lombok**

Project Lombok. Project Lombok is a java library that automatically plugs into your editor and build tools, spicing up your java. Never write another getter or equals method again, with one annotation your class has a fully featured builder, Automate your logging variables, and much more.
